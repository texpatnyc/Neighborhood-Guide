# Neighborhood-Guide
Neighborhood Guide is an interactive guidebook for guests of my short-term rental apartment to help them find cool and interesting places to go in the neighborhood.

Check out the [live version here](https://hidden-oasis-51430.herokuapp.com/).

## Motivation

I run a short-term rental property in NYC.  I wanted to create something a little more interactive and updatable for my guests than just a simple piece of paper with recommendations for them to check out.
